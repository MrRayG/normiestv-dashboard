## getFullAgentContext() — INJECTED INTO EVERY API CALL

This function assembles context that goes into every single Grok call:

```
getSoulContext()         → ~1,200 tokens  (identity, mission, canon, voice)
getKnowledgeContext(6)  → ~800 tokens    (top 6 knowledge entries in full)
getSentimentArc(4)      → ~150 tokens    (last 4 episode emotions)
getPerformanceContext(5) → ~400 tokens   (last 5 post scores + lessons)
─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL PER CALL          → ~2,550 tokens
```

**This runs for: episodes, replies, academy, signal, news, burns = every call.**
